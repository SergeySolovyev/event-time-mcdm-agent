"""
Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) scoring engine.

Evaluates each protocol across four weighted factors:
  - APY (40%):       Raw yield — higher is better
  - Risk (25%):      Utilization-based — lower utilization = safer
  - Cost (20%):      Gas efficiency of switching — amortized over cooldown
  - Stability (15%): TVL change — stable TVL signals healthy protocol

Each factor is normalized to [0, 1], then combined into a weighted score.
The agent rebalances when the best protocol's score exceeds the current
protocol's score by more than SCORE_THRESHOLD.
